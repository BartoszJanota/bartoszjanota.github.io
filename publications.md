I also publish sometimes. Papers listed below are discussing things like FEM, adaptive algorithms, multi-frontal solvers, etc.:

* [Chapter 13. Data Processing Pipelines, Case Study: Spotify](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-site-reliability/9781492029496/ch13.html#case_study_spotify)
*Beyer, B. and Murphy, N.R. and Rensin, D.K. and Kawahara, K. and Thorne, S. The Site Reliability Workbook: Practical Ways to Implement SRE, Chapter 13, Pages 287-299, Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2018.* I co-authored a section describing Event Delivery at Spotify in the newest [Google's SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/). We discuss the architecture of the system, operations and customer integration. I have bee working on this system since July 2016.

* [Automatic Algorithms for the Construction of Element Partition Trees for Isogeometric Finite Element Method](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67792-7_28?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BMUSFh5JASNKOiUppFiv8QA%3D%3D)
